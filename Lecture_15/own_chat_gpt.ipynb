We'll begin by understanding the significance of API keys and utilizing environment variables to ensure security and privacy in our applications. Next, we'll dive into document loading, mastering the handling of various file types and data sources. Following that, we'll tackle document splitting for efficient processing. We'll then proceed to create vector stores and embeddings, crucial for representing the semantic meaning of words. Afterward, we'll explore information retrieval techniques and question-answering capabilities, culminating in the implementation of a chat system based on our model.\n",

    "Creating the API key from OPENAI, [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have obtained the API key, it needs to be securely stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various methods for loading this API key. One approach is to utilize environment files, which should ideally be private and included in the `.gitignore` if working in a collaborative environment. Github, for instance, detects if any keys are uploaded to the platform, triggering an alert and disabling the API key, necessitating the creation of a new one. The key can be manually entered as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `Dotenv`\n",
    "\n",
    "For this method, you can create a `.env` file in the working environment and list the variables as follows: `variable = \"value_variable\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "NAME_OF_VARIABLE=\"sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To use it, `python-dotenv` is employed, which, through the functions `load_dotenv` and `find_dotenv`, loads the variables from the `.env` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# `!pip install python-dotenv`\n",
    "from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv\n",
    "load_dotenv(find_dotenv())\n",
    "\n",
    "secret_variable = os.environ['NAME_OF_VARIABLE']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "For Colab, a form with `getpass` can be introduced, which conceals the API key when entered. However, the drawback compared to the previous method is that the API key needs to be pasted each time the file is executed."

Get what you need, while keeping in mind the demands of your work when choosing specs.\\n\\nA day or two before you start, your manager will email you instructions for your first day. Your manager will be your point of contact for your early projects and activities. You‚Äôll also work with a member of our Ops team who will help you as you set up all the accounts you need to work at 37signals.\\n\\nOn your first day, you‚Äôll log into Basecamp to see a project dedicated to your onboarding called ‚ÄúWelcome, [your name]!‚Äù. Your welcome project will contain a few to-do lists, tailored to your role and linking to accounts or services that you need to set up. You‚Äôll also see to-do lists that your Ops buddy and manager will be working through. Your Ops buddy and your manager will be in contact with you as you set up your environment, should you have questions or get stuck.\\n\\nTo keep everyone's devices safe and secure, we manage all our Mac devices using [Kandji](https://kandji.io) as well as our in-house tool [Shipshape \\uf8ffüîí](https://github.com/basecamp/shipshape/).\\n\\nYour training schedules and [onboarding expectations](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/making-a-career.md#your-first-90-days) will be in your welcome project. You‚Äôll also find docs with helpful links to technical documentation, walkthrough videos, important Basecamp projects, and more.\\n\\nYour welcome project will also contain a list of people to meet over the course of your first few weeks.\\n\\n* Your manager. You and your manager will meet on your first day to sort out a recurring 1:1 schedule and to review your specific onboarding expectations.\\n* Your team. Most teams have a weekly call which you‚Äôll join your first week.\\n* Your 37signals buddy. Your buddy will be someone who‚Äôs not on your immediate team, who‚Äôs worked at 37signals for a while, and who can point you in the right direction when you have a question and don‚Äôt quite know where to turn. They‚Äôll introduce themselves during your first week, to say hi and offer their help. They‚Äôll check in with you periodically throughout your first couple months to see how you‚Äôre settling in.\\n* People Ops. You‚Äôll meet with Andrea to review 37signals policies, benefits, and compensation.\\n\\nAfter your environment has been set up, expectations are clear, and you‚Äôve met who you need to meet, you‚Äôll get to work! You‚Äôll begin working on real projects, with plenty of support and guidance, within your first week. Your responsibilities and impact will increase as you learn and gain confidence over the next few months, and most people are up to speed and feeling fully part of the team in about 3 months.\\n\", metadata={'source': 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basecamp/handbook/master/getting-started.md'})]"

Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\\nprimarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research\\noutcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\\ninvestigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\\nand sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\\nportant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going\\neﬀorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model\\ndevelopment in disciplines like natural language processing and computer\\nvision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\\nThis represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\\nacademic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences\\nand humanities.

    "By default, the vector store retriever uses similarity search. If the underlying vector store supports maximum marginal relevance (`mmr`) search, you can specify that as the search type. Maximum Marginal Relevance is a process that takes into account the diversity of the semantic content of the documents to be outputed. The way this works:\n",

    "1. First, it conducts a semantic search and finds a larger initial pool of documents (20 by default)\n",
    "2. From those documents, it takes the most relevant one (the one with the smallest distance from the query).\n",
    "3. Adds this document to the pool of final relevant picks. We call this set $R$\n",
    "4. For the documents not in $R$, generate a score that rewards relevance and penalizes the proximity to the closest document in $R$.\n",

These resources, along with the LayoutParser model zoo, offer a spectrum of models trained on diverse datasets to support different use cases in document analysis.\\n\\nIn light of this context, the challenges hindering the widespread adoption and reuse of innovations in DIA, particularly in comparison to disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, can be further refined:\\n\\n1. Fragmentation in DIA Tools and Models: Despite the availability of pretrained models and document data collections in DIA, the lack of standardized tools and pipelines for document analysis hinders the seamless integration and reuse of innovations across different stages of DIA tasks. This fragmentation in tools and models complicates the adoption of advanced techniques in document image analysis.\\n\\n2. Limited Optimization for DIA Challenges: While there have been efforts to develop pretrained models and pipelines specific to DIA tasks, the lack of optimization for the unique challenges faced in document analysis limits the widespread adoption of innovations in the field. Unlike disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, where there are more comprehensive tools and frameworks, the optimization for DIA tasks remains a challenge.\\n\\n3. Interdisciplinary Research Support: The availability of diverse datasets and pretrained models in DIA, such as those in the LayoutParser model zoo, presents opportunities for interdisciplinary research. However, the lack of comprehensive tools and platforms tailored to the specific needs of interdisciplinary research in document image analysis hinders the widespread adoption and reuse of innovations in the field.\\n\\nBy addressing these refined challenges, such as the fragmentation in DIA tools and models, the limited optimization for DIA challenges, and the need for better support for interdisciplinary research, tools like LayoutParser can play a crucial role in streamlining the adoption and reuse of innovations in document image analysis.'"
