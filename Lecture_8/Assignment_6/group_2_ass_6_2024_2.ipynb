I should be able to run your scripts in my computer and get all the results. **USE RELATIVE PATHS**. An error or exception or anything that breaks the code will means NO GRADE (0). Additionally, you are not able to modify any file handly. It also means NO GRADE (0). Comment everything you think will help others read your script. We expect 0 errors using GitHub. Everything will be graded!\n",
