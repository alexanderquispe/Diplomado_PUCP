Té para tres - Gustavo Cerati

Las tazas sobre el mantel
La lluvia derramada
Un poco de miel
Un poco de miel
No basta
El eclipse no fue parcial
Y cegó nuestras miradas
Te vi que llorabas
Te vi que llorabas
Por él
Té para tres
Un sorbo de distracción
Buscando descifrarnos
No hay nada mejor
No hay nada mejor
Que casa

Lessons in love
I'm not proud, I was wrong
And the truth is hard to take
I felt sure we had enough
But our love went overboard
Lifeboat lies lost at sea
I've been trying to reach your shore
Waves of doubt keep drowning me

All the dreams that we were building
We never fulfilled them
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love

For restless eyes, egos burn
And the mold is hard to break
Now we've waded in too deep
And love is overboard
Heavy hearts, token words
All the hopes I ever had
Fade like footprints in the sand

All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love

If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it, we could use it, yeah
Lessons in love

Lost without love

Lessons in love
When will you ever learn
Lessons in love
When there's nowhere left to turn

Lessons in love
Don't let your spirit burn
Lessons in love
I'll wait 'till you return

All the dreams that we were building
We never lived them
We could use it, we should use it, yeah (lessons in love)
Lessons in love

All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better (could be better), should be better
Lessons in love

If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it, we could use it, yeah
Lessons in love

Falling forever - Dua Lipa

How long?
How long?
Are you good at holdin' on?
I know the mind is quick to throw away the moment
Where this takes us, maybe I don't wanna know yet
'Cause for now you're all I want
They say you got it, then it's gone
I don't believe that every flame has to get colder
I hope the feelings that you give me carry over
'Til tomorrow and beyond
How long
How long
Can it just keep getting better?
Can we keep fallin' forever?
How long
How long
Can we stay, like this, together?
Can we keep fallin' forever?
You could wake up all alone
So, tonight, I'll give you somethin' to remember
An eternity's impossible to measure
But it feels right where we are
I'm (I'm) fallin' deep (fallin' deep), deep in your arms, baby
Baby, I'm yours to keep, keep me close
'Til tomorrow and beyond
How long
How long
Can it just keep getting better?
Can we keep fallin' forever?
How long
How long
Can we stay, like this, together?
Can we keep fallin' forever?
How long, I wanna know
Can you ride through any storm?
Can you ride from night 'til dawn?
'Til tomorrow and beyond?
How long
How long
Can it just keep getting better?
Can we keep fallin' forever?
How long
How long
Can we stay, like this, together?
Can we keep fallin' forever?
How long
Can it just keep getting better?
Can we keep fallin' forever?
Oh, ooh
How long?
How, how long?

Your hand holding mine - Yellow Days

A grew soul, purple and blue
But I think I've found something in you
You hold my hand so close between yours
All of this time I always thought it would be your hand
Holding mine
Oh, holding mine
Oh, holding mine
Oh, holding mine
Holding mine
Always thought it would be your hand
Holding mine
Well these days I just count the hours
Oh, shape shifting boy in all of those scours
You hold your hand so close between yours
All of this time I always thought it would be your hand
Holding mine
Oh, holding mine
Oh, holding mine
Oh, holding mine
Holding mine
Always thought it would be your hand
Holding mine
Holding mine
Oh, holding mine
Oh, holding mine
Oh, holding mine
Holding mine
Always thought it would be your hand
Holding mine
Always thought it would be your hand
Holding mine
Always thought it would be your hand
Holding mine, yeah

Never Tear Us Apart - INXS

Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart
I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart
We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears
I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart
I (don't ask me)
I was standing (you know it's true)
Mm, you were there (worlds collided)
Two worlds collided (we're shining through)
And they could never tear us apart
You (don't ask me)
You were standing (you know it's true)
I was there (worlds collided)
Two worlds collided (we're shining through)
And they could never tear us apart
I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
