  Favorite song: Blank Space
  Nice to meet you, where you been?
  I could show you incredible things
  Magic, madness, heaven, sin
  Saw you there and I thought
  "Oh, my God, look at that face
  You look like my next mistake
  Love's a game, wanna play?" Ay
  New money, suit and tie
  I can read you like a magazine
  Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
  And I know you heard about me
  So hey, let's be friends
  I'm dying to see how this one ends
  Grab your passport and my hand
  I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
  So it's gonna be forever
  Or it's gonna go down in flames
  You can tell me when it's over, mm
  If the high was worth the pain
  Got a long list of ex-lovers
  They'll tell you I'm insane
  'Cause you know I love the players
  And you love the game
  'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
  We'll take this way too far
  It'll leave you breathless, mm
  Or with a nasty scar
  Got a long list of ex-lovers
  They'll tell you I'm insane
  But I've got a blank space, baby
  And I'll write your name
  Cherry lips, crystal skies
  I could show you incredible things
  Stolen kisses, pretty lies
  You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
  Find out what you want
  Be that girl for a month
  Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
  Screaming, crying, perfect storms
  I can make all the tables turn
  Rose garden filled with thorns
  Keep you second guessing like
  "Oh, my God, who is she?"
  I get drunk on jealousy
  But you'll come back each time you leave
  'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
  So it's gonna be forever
  Or it's gonna go down in flames
  You can tell me when it's over, mm
  If the high was worth the pain
  Got a long list of ex-lovers
  They'll tell you I'm insane
  'Cause you know I love the players
  And you love the game
  'Cause we're young, and we're reckless (oh)
  We'll take this way too far
  It'll leave you breathless, mm (oh)
  Or with a nasty scar
  Got a long list of ex-lovers
  They'll tell you I'm insane (insane)
  But I've got a blank space, baby
  And I'll write your name
  Boys only want love if it's torture
  Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
  Boys only want love if it's torture
  Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
  So it's gonna be forever
  Or it's gonna go down in flames
  You can tell me when it's over (over)
  If the high was worth the pain
  Got a long list of ex-lovers
  They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)
  'Cause you know I love the players
  And you love the game
  'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
  We'll take this way too far (ooh)
  It'll leave you breathless, mm
  Or with a nasty scar (leave a nasty scar)
  Got a long list of ex-lovers
  They'll tell you I'm insane
  But I've got a blank space, baby
  And I'll write your name

  Favorite song: Te sigo

  Comenzando por la campana, desde arriba
  creciendo en forma circular
  empezando a caminar

  Repitiendo algunas veces tus palabras
  y esperando en su lugar 
  aprendimos a volar

  Siempre yo te sigo a todas partes
  a veces yo no puedo pero quiero
  agradezco, la alegría que me das

  Siempre yo te sigo a todas partes
  a veces yo no puedo aunque lo deseo
  pero yo te quiero de verdad

  Sobre tierra que embarraba, aún recuerdo
  comprendimos en señal
  la única verdad.

  Convirtiendo lo que nos pegaste, en un circuito
  asfixiando la pared
  pudimos ver la realidad.

  Siempre yo te sigo a todas partes
  a veces yo no puedo pero quiero
  agradezco, la alegría que me das

  Siempre yo te sigo a todas partes
  a veces yo no puedo aunque lo deseo
  pero yo te quiero de verdad

  Señalando todo lo estampado, desde arriba
  creciendo en forma circular
  logramos mostrar la realidad

  Repitiendo algunas veces tus palabras
  asfixiando la pared
  todo vuelve a comenzar

  Siempre yo te sigo a todas partes
  a veces yo no puedo pero quiero
  agradezco, la alegría que me das

  Siempre yo te sigo a todas partes
  a veces yo no puedo aunque lo deseo
  pero yo te quiero de verdad

  Favorite song: Live Forever

  Maybe I don't really wanna know
  How your garden grows
  'Cause I just wanna fly
  Lately, did you ever feel the pain
  In the morning rain
  As it soaks you to the bone?
  Maybe I just wanna fly
  Wanna live, I don't wanna die
  Maybe I just wanna breathe
  Maybe I just don't believe
  Maybe you're the same as me
  We see things they'll never see
  You and I are gonna live forever
  I said maybe I don't really wanna know
  How your garden grows
  'Cause I just wanna fly
  Lately, did you ever feel the pain
  In the morning rain
  As it soaks you to the bone?
  Maybe I will never be
  All the things that I wanna be
  Now is not the time to cry
  Now's the time to find out why
  I think you're the same as me
  We see things they'll never see
  You and I are gonna live forever
  Maybe I don't really wanna know
  How your garden grows
  'Cause I just wanna fly
  Lately, did you ever feel the pain
  In the morning rain
  As it soaks you to the bone?
  Maybe I just wanna fly
  Wanna live, I don't wanna die
  Maybe I just wanna breathe
  Maybe I just don't believe
  Maybe you're the same as me
  We see things they'll never see
  You and I are gonna live forever
  Gonna live forever
  Gonna live forever
  We're gonna live forever
  Gonna live forever
  Gonna live forever
  Gonna live forever
