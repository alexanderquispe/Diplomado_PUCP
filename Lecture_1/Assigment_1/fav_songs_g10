You got to be crazy
You gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes
And when you're on the street
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat
With your eyes closed
And then moving in silently down wind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right, without thinking
And after a while you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
You'll get the chance to put the knife in
You gotta keep one eye
Looking over your shoulder
You know, it's going to get harder
Harder, harder as you get older
Yeah, and in the end you'll pack up
And fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer
And when you lose control
You'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows
The bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight
You used to need to throw around
So have a good drown
As you go down all alone
Dragged down by the stone
Got to admit
That I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me
As if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off
This creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground
How can I find my way out of this maze?
Deaf, dumb and blind
You just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable
And no one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do
Would be to isolate the winner
Everything's done under the sun
But you believe at heart everyone's a killer
Who was born in a house full of pain?
Who was trained not to spit in the fan?
Who was told what to do by the man?
Who was broken by trained personnel?
Who was fitted with collar and chain?
Who was given a pat on the back?
Who was breaking away from the pack?
Who was only a stranger at home?
Who was ground down in the end?
Who was found dead on the phone?
Who was dragged down by the stone?
Who was dragged down by the stone?

3. I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met
And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you
I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met
When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met
I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met

Rata de dos patas
Rata inmunda
Animal rastrero
Escoria de la vida
Adefesio mal hecho
Infrahumano
Espectro del infierno
Maldita sabandija
Cuánto daño me has hecho
Alimaña
Culebra ponzoñosa
Deshecho de la vida
Te odio y te desprecio
Rata de dos patas
Te estoy hablando a ti
Porque un bicho rastrero
Aún siendo el más maldito
Comparado contigo
Se queda muy chiquito
Maldita sanguijuela
Maldita cucaracha
Que infectas donde picas
Que hieres y que matas
Alimaña
Culebra ponzoñosa
Deshecho de la vida
Te odio y te desprecio
Rata de dos patas
Te estoy hablando a ti
Porque un bicho rastrero
Aún siendo el más maldito
Comparado contigo
Se queda muy chiquito
Me estás oyendo inútil
Hiena del infierno
Cuánto te odio y te desprecio
Maldita sanguijuela
Maldita cucaracha
Que infectas donde picas
Que hieres y que matas
Alimaña
Culebra ponzoñosa
Deshecho de la vida
Te odio y te desprecio
Rata de dos patas
Te estoy hablando a ti
Porque un bicho rastrero
Aún siendo el más maldito
Comparado contigo
Se queda muy chiquito

Money
Get away
You get a good job with more pay and you're okay
Money
It's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four star, daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team
Money
Get back
I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack
Money
It's a hit
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first-class traveling section
And I think I need a Lear jet
Money
It's a crime
Share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie
Money
So they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise
It's no surprise that they're giving none away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
I was in the right
Yes, absolutely in the right
I certainly was in the right
Yeah, I was definitely in the right, that geezer was cruisin' for a bruisin'
Yeah!
Why does anyone do anything?
I don't know, I was really drunk at the time
Just telling him it was in, he could get it in number two
He was asking why it wasn't coming up on freight 11
And after, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why
It wasn't coming up on freight eleven
