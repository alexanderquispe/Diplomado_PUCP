It's about time we get it straight
It's about time we get it straight
Gimme a minute if it ain't too late
Gimme a minute if it ain't too late
대충 무리였나봐, babe
daechung muriyeonnabwa, babe
애먼 기분만 해친 채
aemeon gibunman haechin chae
버티기가 이만큼 힘든데
beotigiga imankeum himdeunde
Stay with me till the end of the day
Stay with me till the end of the day

Maybe we
Maybe we
Could be
Could be
Slow dancing
Slow dancing
Until the morning
Until the morning
We could be romancing
We could be romancing
The night away
The night away

Turnin' me up and back off like this
Turnin' me up and back off like this
What do you want? Do you not like it?
What do you want? Do you not like it?
Stop teasin' me, girl
Stop teasin' me, girl
Now, you made me leave my heart out here
Now, you made me leave my heart out here
날 딛고 올라가
nal ditgo ollaga
다시 새로 누군가 (got it on, did you?)
dasi saero nugun-ga (got it on, did you?)
닮았던 우리가
dalmatdeon uriga
먼 이웃 같은 날
meon iut gateun nal
