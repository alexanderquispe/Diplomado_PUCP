### Fernando Alonso SÃ¡nchez Prieto - Lana del Rey/The greatest
    I miss Long Beach and I miss you, babe
    I miss dancing with you the most of all
    I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go
    Dennis' last stop before Kokomo

    Those nights were on fire
    We couldn't get higher
    We didn't know that we had it all
    But nobody warns you before the fall

    And I'm wasted
    Don't leave, I just need a wake-up call
    I'm facing the greatest
    The greatest loss of them all
    The culture is lit and I had a ball
    I guess I'm signing off after all

    I miss New York and I miss the music
    Me and my friends, we miss rock 'n' roll
    I want shit to feel just like it used to
    And baby, I was doing nothing the most of all
    
    The culture is lit
    And if this is it
    I had a ball
    I guess that I'm burned out after all

    I'm wasted
    Don't leave, I just need a wake-up call
    I'm facing the greatest
    The greatest loss of them all
    The culture is lit and I had a ball
    I guess that I'm burned out after all
    If this is it, I'm signing off
    Miss doing nothing the most of all

    Hawaii just missed a fireball
    L.A. is in flames, it's getting hot
    Kanye West is blond and gone
    "Life on Mars" ain't just a song
    Oh, the live stream's almost on
