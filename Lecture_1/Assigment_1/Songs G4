There is a light that never goes out - The Smiths

Take me out tonight
Where there's music and there's people
And they're young and alive
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one
Anymore
Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people
And I want to see life
Driving in your car
Oh, please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their home
And I'm welcome no more
And if a double-decker bus
Crashes into us
To die by your side
Is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten ton truck
Kills the both of us
To die by your side
Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine
Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
And in the darkened underpass
I thought, "Oh God, my chance has come at last"
But then a strange fear gripped me
And I just couldn't ask
Take me out tonight
Oh, take me anywhere, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one, la-di-dum
Oh, I haven't got one
Oh, oh
And if a double-decker bus
Crashes into us
To die by your side
Is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten ton truck
Kills the both of us
To die by your side
Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine
Oh, there is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out

Love The Way You Lie

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight

High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffing paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fucking hates me, and I love it, wait!

Where you going? I'm leaving you
No you ain't, come back
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane

But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped: Who's that dude? I don't even know his name
I laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie

You ever loved somebody so much
You can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin'
Yeah, them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fucking sick of looking at 'em?

You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit them
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in them

It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records playing over

But you promised her
Next time you'd show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie

Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded

Baby, please, come back
It wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though

Come inside
Pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall

Next time? There will be no next time!
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back

I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
Just gonna

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie
