What more can I say - Teddy Swins

Love can't make you stay
Drunken rage came stormin' in
5 AM, you woke me up again
'Cause the doubles on ice and your friend Diane
Got you all up in your head again
About a picture on my phone from a girl I used to know
Got your searchin' flights back home
I'm like, please
Don't go
Got my heart rate up real high
Vocabulary runnin' low
Out of breath, I keep goin' and goin', oh, no
If I'm a record then I'm broke
You don't like my song no more
And all I need to know is
What more (what more) can I say (more can I say)
To you baby
When I'm out of words you haven't heard?
If love (if love) can't make you stay (can't make you stay)
It's your play
So tell me what more can I say?
Beat me up and leave me black and blue
Do whatever that you gotta do
Throw the dirty laundry in the street
Chipped acrylic now you're blamin' me
About a picture on my phone from a million years ago
Got you searchin' flights back home
I'm like, please
What more (what more) can I say (more can I say)
To you baby
When I'm out of words you haven't heard?
If love (if love) can't make you stay (can't make you stay)
It's your play
Tell me what I'm supposed to say?
Except don't go
Got my heart rate up real high
Vocabulary runnin' low
Out of breath, I keep goin' and goin', oh, no
If I'm a record then I'm broke
You don't like my song no more
So tell me what more can I say? (Say)
Say (can't make you stay)
