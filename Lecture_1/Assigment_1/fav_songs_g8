I woke up to the morning sky, first
Baby blue, just like we rehearsed
When I get up off this ground
I shake leaves back down to the brown, brown, brown, brown
'Til I'm clean
Then I walk where I'd be shaded by the trees
By a meadow of green
For about a mile
I'm headed to town, town, town, in style
With all my favorite colors, yes, sir
All my favorite colors, right on
My sisters and my brothers
See 'em like no other
All my favorite colors
It's a good day to be
A good day for me
A good day to see
My favorite colors, colors
My sisters and my brothers
They see 'em like no other
All my favorite colors
Now take me to other side
Little bitty blues bird flies
And gray clouds, or white walls, or blue skies
We gon' fly, feel alright
And we gon' (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh), yeah
It sound like (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh), yeah
The least I can say, I anticipate
A homecoming parade as we renegade
In the morning, right on
With all my favorite colors, yes, sir
All my favorite colors, yes, ma'am
My sisters and my brothers
See 'em like no other
All my favorite colors
All my favorite colors, right
All my favorite colors, yes, ma'am
My sisters and my brothers
See 'em like no other
All my favorite colors
It's a good day to be
A good day for me
A good day to see my favorite colors, colors
My sisters and my brothers
They see 'em like no other
All my favorite colors

When you close your eyes and go to sleep
And it's down to the sound of a heartbeat
I can hear the things that you're dreaming about
When you open up your heart
And the truth comes out
You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right
'Cause I hear it in the night
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
When I hold you in my arms at night
Don't you know you're sleeping in the spotlight
And all your dreams that you keep inside
You're telling me the secrets
That you just can't hide
When you close your eyes and you fall asleep
Everything about you is a mystery

This being human is a guest house
Every morning, a new arrival
A joy, a depression, a meanness
Some momentary awareness comes
As an unexpected visitor
Welcome and entertain them all
Even if they are a crowd of sorrows
Who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture
Still, treat each guest honorably
He may be clearing you out for some new delight
The dark thought, the shame, the malice
Meet them at the door laughing and invite them in
Be grateful for whoever comes
Because each has been sent as a guide from beyond

Can see it from the way you looking at me
You don't think I'm worth your time
Don't care about the person that I might be
Offended that I walk the line
So what if I'm not
So what if I'm not everything you wanted me to be?
So what if I am
So what if I am more than you can see?
When you treat me like that, when you treat me like that
It's pushin' me harder, it's pushin' me harder
When you breakin' my back, when you breakin' my back
I only get stronger, I only get stronger
I should've walked away one year ago
When you said I wouldn't make it out alive
When you treat me like that, when you treat me like that
I only get stronger, I only get stronger
When you treat me like that
