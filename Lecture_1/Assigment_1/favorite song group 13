1. Mattias Salazar, No More Parties in LA, mattias.salazar@pucp.edu.pe
Lyric:
La di da da-a, da-a (I like this flavor)
La da da da di da da-a, la-a
Let me tell you, I'm out here
From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more (Los Angeles)
Please (shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (shake that body, party that body)
Please (shake that body, party that body)
Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good though, the head still good though
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity
And yeah G, I was all for it
She said K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet
I'mma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy
Scary
Scary
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A
Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowing the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em really
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive, need to put up some god damn barricades
I be paranoid every time
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'
The problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took 6 months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
God damn, got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop it like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money, money, money, money
Big, big money, money, money, money
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know who can take your place
Please, no more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more (Los Angeles)
I'm out here from a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far
SWISH

2. Mauricio Rivas, Wesley's Theory, mauricio.rivas@pucp.edu.pe
Lyric:
Every nigga is a star, ay, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ay, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ay
Who will deny that you and I and
Every nigga is a star?
Hit me!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You'll slip through the cracks hopin' that you'll survive
Gather your weight, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?
When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the prez with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that
We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money, go back home
Money, go back home
We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money, go back home
Money, go back home
(Everybody get out!)
At first, I did love you (love you)
But now I just wanna fuck (I just wanna fuck)
Late nights thinkin' of you (of you)
Until I get my nut ('til I get my nut)
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board (across the board)
Destroyed, but what for?
Yo, what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (that's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Clich√©? Then say, "Fuck your haters"
I can see the baller in you
I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby, count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a Gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five
Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (it's quite a drop, drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (when you're on top, you got it)
You got a medal for us
Leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind
We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money, go back home
Money, go back home
We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money, go back home (tax man comin', tax man comin')
Money, go back home (tax man comin', tax man comin'!)

3. Daniel Montjoy, Chocolate, dmontjoy@gmail.com
Lyric:
Hey now, call it a split, because you know that you will
Oh, oh, you bite your friends like chocolate
You said, we go where nobody know
With guns hidden under our petticoat
Oh, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Now run, run away from the boys in blue
Oh, my car smells like chocolate
Hey now, I think about what to do
I think about what to say
I think about how to think
Pause it, play it, pause it, play it, pause it
Oh, we go where nobody know
With guns hidden under our petticoat
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe
We got guns hidden under our petticoat
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
If you don't stop smoking it
That's what she said
She said, we're dressed in black from head to toe
With guns hidden under our petticoat
And we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Hey now, we're building up speed as we're approaching a hill
Oh, my hair smells like chocolate
Hey now, you say you're gonna quit it
But you're never gonna quit it
Gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it, gotta get it, go!
And play it cool
Oh, you said, we go where nobody know
With guns hidden under our petticoat
No, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe
We got guns hidden under our petticoat
We're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Well, I think we better go
Seriously better go
Said the feds are here, you know
Seriously better go, oh no
Well, I think we better go
Said the feds are here, you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go
We go where nobody know
With guns hidden under our petticoat
Oh, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe
With guns hidden under our petticoat
We're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no, no, no
Well, I think we better go
Seriously better go
Said the feds are here, you know
Seriously better go
Well, I think we better go
Said the feds are here, you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go

4. Andre Visurraga, It was a shit show, andre.visurraga@pucp.edu.pe
Lyric:
I love you, yes
And I'll confess
The thought of staying is so enticing
And when you speak
My knees get weak
I can't believe what I'm sacrificing
But let's get real
We know the deal
So darling, let's not tiptoe
This thing we had
Was not just bad
It was a shit show
We can't undo
Can't make amends
Dysfunction is our lingua franca
We can't unscrew
Each others friends
We're Jerry Springer, not Casablanca
There's hard to get
Then there's neglect
To say it's fate, you'd have to be a bit slow
Not to be crass
But this sucked ass
This was a shit show
Chernobyl next to us looks like a campfire
Hurricane Katrina was just bad weather
We have chemistry, of course, but that's a formula for divorce
A play about pieces of feces is what we are together
Oh, what the hell
Let's get a hotel
'Cause life is short and we're not getting any younger
But after sex
What happens next?
I mean in the long run, not just fatigue and hunger
And when you say
That I should stay
That's exactly when I should split though
I won't forget
I won't regret
This beautiful, heart-stopping, breathtaking, life-changing
