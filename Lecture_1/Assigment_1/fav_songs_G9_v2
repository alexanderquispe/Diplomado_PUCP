Daniela (daniela.floresg@pucp.edu.pe) : Strawberry Moon - Twice
今夜 月は赤い ah ah 不思議な夜
会ってた時の余韻 忘れたくない hah
急に近づいて 見つめるから
体中が熱くなってた no way
ため息ばかりで 乱されてる まだ
時間戻してたい midnight
眠れないほど 叩く鼓動
あの瞬間で時を止めてたい
ふたつの影 かさなるまで
Strawberry moonlight
Wishing moon 叶えてよ この恋を
Addicted to you 髪も指先も
あなたを意識してる
心の全ては見せないわ
'Cause I know that
明日また会える? って
言いかけて やめたの
追いかけたら 夢中で ただ夢中で
逃げるでしょ? 恋はいつでも
Let me know
Hey, won't you let me know
帰り際した hug
What are you thinking now?
探して 見つけて 二人の hide and seek
何度 傷ついても また恋する
綺麗な花に生まれ変わって oh mind
冷たくされたり 優しくされたり
掴みきれないの you are
もどかしい距離 飛び越えて
あの瞬間が始まりだから
愛し方を教えて 今
Strawberry moonlight
Wishing moon 叶えるわ この恋を
予言なら 明日の私は
あなたに会いに走る
心に火をつけてしまった
You don't know me
早く見抜いてよ 危険な恋の炎
追いかけてる 夢中で ただ夢中で
気づいたら あなたしかいない
You're special to me
Only you are seen
出会えたことで変わるの
Oh, my destiny
All I need is you
All I need is you
そばにいて
Wishing moon 叶えるわ この恋を
予言なら 明日の私は
あなたに会いに走る
心に火をつけてしまった
You don't know me
早く見抜いてよ 危険な恋の炎
追いかけてる 夢中で ただ夢中で
気づいたら あなたしかいない
Wishing moon 叶えるわ この恋を
予言なら 明日の私は
愛を手にしてる

Yanell (yanell.huaman@pucp.edu.pe): Stop crying your heart out - Oasis
Hold up
Hold on
Don't be scared
You'll never change what's been and gone
May your smile (may your smile)
Shine on (shine on)
Don't be scared (don't be scared)
Your destiny may keep you warm
'Cause all of the stars are fading away
Just try not to worry, you'll see them someday
Take what you need, and be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
Get up (get up)
Come on (come on)
Why're you scared? (I'm not scared)
You'll never change what's been and gone
'Cause all of the stars are fading away
Just try not to worry, you'll see them someday
Take what you need, and be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
'Cause all of the stars are fading away
Just try not to worry, you'll see them someday
Just take what you need, and be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
We're all of the stars, we're fading away
Just try not to worry, you'll see us some day
Just take what you need, and be on your way
And stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out
Stop crying your heart out

Osman (osmanpasapera@gmail.com): I've Been Dazed - Michael Kiwanuka
I've been dazed
My pride is gone
My mistake
Guess I'll move on
London days
It's cold outside
Lost my way
You know I've tried
Won't you carry on?
Won't you carry on?
Help me carry on
Won't you carry on?
The Lord said to me (The Lord said to me)
Time is a healer (Time is a healer)
Love is the answer (Love is the answer)
I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
The Lord said to me (The Lord said to me)
Time is a healer (Time is a healer)
Truth is the answer (Truth is the answer)
I'm on the way (I'm on the way)
Lost my way
You know I've tried
The Lord said to me
Help me carry on
Won't you carry on? (The Lord said to me, the Lord said to me)

Fernando: Iris - Goo Goo Dolls
And I'd give up forever to touch you
'Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now
'Cause all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
So and sooner or later, it's over
I just don't wanna miss you tonight
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
So when everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am, hey
I want you guys to take this one home, alright?
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And I just want you to know who I am
I just want you to know who I am
And I just want you to know who I am
Yeah
You guys are the best
This the the best 4th of July ever
Ever, ever, ever
Give yourself some love
You have no idea how much we love you, goodnight
Thank you for sticking around
Alright y'all, yeah
We gonna try do one more for you, okay?
We got one more
