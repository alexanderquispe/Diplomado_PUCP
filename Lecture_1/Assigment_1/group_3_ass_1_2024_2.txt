Cuando nadie ve

Soñé un verano que se hiciera eterno
Desde el momento en que vi tu mirada
Me derretiste con esa mirada
Pero el verano se volvió un invierno
Cuando vi que otros brazos te esperaban
Me congelé mientras yo te esperaba
Y ahora entiendo cual es mi papel
Nos queremos cuando nadie ve
Las balas perdidas de este amor
Prefiero no verlas en mi piel
Si me preguntan por ti
Diré que es mentira
Que toda una vida he soñado contigo
Yo sueño contigo
Si me preguntan por ti
Diré que no es cierto
Que duele por dentro que no estés conmigo
Te quiero conmigo
Te miro, me miras
Y el mundo no gira
Todo parece mentira
Tú sigues, yo sigo
Es nuestro castigo
Fingir que somos amigos
Y cuando no haya testigos
Mi vida entera te daré
Cuando nadie ve
Cuando nadie ve
Y ahora entiendo cual es mi papel
Nos queremos cuando nadie ve
Las balas perdidas de este amor
Prefiero no verlas en mi piel
Si me preguntan por ti
Diré que es mentira
Que toda una vida he soñado contigo
Yo sueño contigo
Si me preguntan por ti
Diré que no es cierto
Que duele por dentro que no estés conmigo
Te quiero conmigo
Te miro, me miras
Y el mundo no gira
Todo parece mentira
Tu sigues, yo sigo
Es nuestro castigo
Fingir que somos amigos
Y cuando no haya testigos
Mi vida entera te daré
Cuando nadie ve
Cuando nadie ve
Si me preguntan por ti
Diré que es mentira
Que toda una vida he soñado contigo
Yo sueño contigo
Si me preguntan por ti
Diré que no es cierto
Que duele por dentro que no estés conmigo
Te quiero conmigo
Te miro, me miras
Y el mundo no gira
Todo parece mentira
Tú sigues, yo sigo
Es nuestro castigo
Fingir que somos amigos
Y cuando no haya testigos
Mi vida entera te daré
Cuando nadie ve

Subsonic Eye - "Snake Outside"
There's a snake outside your door,
Let it sleep 'till noon.
Bright 'till noon
There's a snake outside your door,
Let it smoke 'till noon
Sleep 'till noon comes on
It's time to wake up
It's time to wake up
My love is eyes, my eyes are brown
My love is tired, we're on the bed
Zorro masks, we're on the train
Caulfield life, kafka lines
It's time to wake up
Sun burned skin,
Sun bred limbs
You came.
I think I would have rained
If I knew, I would have rained
If I knew, I would have rained
If I knew, I would have rained

I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are all I can feel
Remembering you standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in, holding you close
How I always held close in your fear
Remembering you running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
You screamed at the make-believe, screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage to let it all go
Remembering you, fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white, so delicate
Lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark
Remembering you how you used to be
Slow drowned, you were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes, but I never see anything
If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart all my pictures of you
Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
But always just breaking apart
My pictures of you
There was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart
My pictures of you

Shake me down
Not a lot of people left around
Who knows now
Softly laying on the ground, ooh
Not a lot of people left around, ooh
In my life, I've seen
People walk into the sea
Just to find memories
Plagued by constant misery
Their eyes cast down
Fixed upon the ground
Their eyes cast down
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun
Shake me down
Cut my hair on a silver cloud
Broken sound
Softly laying on the ground, ooh
Not a lot of people left around, ooh
In my past, bittersweet
There's no love between the sheets
Taste the blood, broken dreams
Lonely times indeed
With eyes cast down
Fixed upon the ground
Eyes cast down
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun
Turn back now it's time for me to let go
Way down had to find a place to lay low
Lampshade turned around into a light post
Walk around the corner
Never saw it coming, still
I try to make a move
It almost stopped me from belief
I don't wanna know the future
But I'm like Rolling Thunder
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
Even on a cloudy day
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the
I'll keep my eyes fixed on the sun
Shake me down
Not a lot of people left around, ooh

Its not just me, its everybody - Weyes Blood

Sitting at this party
Wondering if anyone knows me
Really sees who I am
Oh, it's been so long since I felt really known
Fragile in the morning
Can't hold on to much of anything
With this hole in my hand
I can't pretend that we always keep what we find
Oh yes, everybody splits apart sometimes

Living in the wake of overwhelming changes
We've all become strangers
Even to ourselves
We just can't help
We can't see from far away
To know that every wave might not be the same
But it's all a part of one big thing

Oh, it's not just me, it's not just me
It's not just me, it's everybody (Everybody)
Eh, eh

Everybody, everybody, everybody

Mercy is the only
Cure for being so lonely
Has a time ever been more revealing
That the people are hurting?
Oh, it's not just me
I guess it's everybody
Yes, we all bleed the same way

Oh, it's not just me, it's not just me
It's not just me, it's everybody (Everybody)
Eh, eh, eh

Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody, everybody

Oh, it's not just me, it's not just me
It's not just me, it's everybody
It's not just me
