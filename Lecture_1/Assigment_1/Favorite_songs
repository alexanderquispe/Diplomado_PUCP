#### 1. Daniela Santander: Strangers In The Night

        Strangers in the night exchanging glances
        Wondering in the night
        What were the chances we'd be sharing love
        Before the night was through
        Something in your eyes was so inviting
        Something in your smile was so exciting
        Something in my heart
        Told me I must have you
        Strangers in the night
        Two lonely people we were strangers in the night
        Up to the moment
        When we said our first hello
        Little did we know
        Love was just a glance away
        A warm embracing dance away, and
        Ever since that night we've been together
        Lovers at first sight, in love forever
        It turned out so right
        For strangers in the night
        Love was just a glance away
        A warm embracing dance away
        Ever since that night we've been together
        Lovers at first sight, in love forever
        It turned out so right
        For strangers in the night
