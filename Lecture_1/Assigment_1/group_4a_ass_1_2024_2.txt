Alejandra Navarro- Undisclosed desires
I know you've suffered
But I don't want you to hide
It's cold and loveless
I won't let you be denied
Soothing
I'll make you feel pure
Trust me
You can be sure
I want to reconcile the violence in your heart
I want to recognise your beauty's not just a mask
I want to exorcise the demons from your past
I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart
You trick your lovers
That you're wicked and divine
You may be a sinner
But your innocence is mine
Please me
Show me how it's done
Tease me
You are the one
I want to reconcile the violence in your heart
I want to recognise your beauty's not just a mask
I want to exorcise the demons from your past
I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart
Please me
Show me how it's done
Trust me
You are the one
I want to reconcile the violence in your heart
I want to recognise your beauty's not just a mask
I want to exorcise the demons from your past
I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart

Jesus Gamboa - Águas passadas
Deixa rolar,
Deixa fluir,
Só não deixe de aprender.
Pode voltar, pode te confundir
Só depende de você!
Águas passadas só irão afogar alguém
Que desistiu de lutar.
Seja forte e não se deixe levar,
Pois a fraqueza é o mal querendo entrar.
Quem foi que disse que seria fácil?
A dificuldade engrandece a conquista.
Debaixo da ponte espero a tempestade,
Mas quando ela passar eu dou a volta por cima.
Águas passadas só irão afogar alguém
Que desistiu de lutar.
Seja forte e não se deixe levar,
Pois, a fraqueza é o mal querendo entrar;
Não deixe ele entrar.
Vivo o momento antes que o tempo possa acabar!
Águas passadas só irão afogar alguém
Que desistiu de lutar.
Seja forte e não se deixe levar,
Pois, a fraqueza é o mal querendo,
Mas eu não deixo ele entrar!

Andrea - The Archer 
Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold onto you
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling?
But who could stay?
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold onto you


Vania -Sonate Pacifique
I'm feeling my heart
Beating with the rhythm of her body slowly moves
I love this feeling
Mm-mm, yeah-yeah
Well, I can't deny it, mm
She turns me on, and I can't control this burning desire
I wish we could, having fun under the sun
I don't know what it is, but there is a trick in her
Who works on me so well
And I can't deny it, mm
She turns me on like a firecracker in the summer sun
I can feel my mind
Slowly fading with the smell of her perfume
And when she's dancing
Oh damn, mm-mm
I'm feeling my heart
Beating with the rhythm of her body slowly moves
I love this feeling
Mm-mm, yeah-yeah
Well, I can't deny it, mm
She turns me on, and I can't control this burning desire
I wish we could, having fun under the sun
I don't know what it is, but there is a trick in her
Who works on me so well
And I can't deny it, mm
She turns me on like a firecracker in the summer sun
I can feel my mind
Slowly fading with the smell of her perfume
And when she's dancing
Oh damn, mm-mm
She turns me on
