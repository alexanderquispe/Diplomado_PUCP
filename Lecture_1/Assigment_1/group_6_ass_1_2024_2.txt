Song: Small Bump (Ed Sheran)

You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump
In four months you're brought to life
And I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you
You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright
Ooh, you're just a small bump unknown
You'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers
And a dimple beneath your chin
Fingernails the size of a half grain of rice

Song: Fin del tiempo

Fin del tiempo para el que no ve
Para el que duda y miente y cree que se salvará
Fe, no se encuentra en lo material
Es una escala espiritual que aún nos falta conocer
Libre solo serás con verdad
Perdona y aprende a pedir perdón, eso es libertad
No mires más lo que te daña
Porque no es una aventura, es tu vida real
Ven, cambiemos el mundo con unión
Lancemos con el corazón la mejor forma de pensar
Y pon en uso tus sentimientos
Teniendo en cuenta que el amor siempre estuvo y estarán, ah-ah-ah-an
Tranquilidad en tu alma, busca lo real
Lo real es lo eterno, siente y no pienses más
Tal vez me escuches o tal vez te irás
Pero sé que estás seguro que digo la verdad
Hay muchos que piensan con los pies
Por eso el mundo está al revés, ¿o es que acaso no lo ves?
Y no es necesario ser sabio, un sacerdote o profesor
Para entender qué es el amor
No, no habrá fronteras, si, si no hay egoísmo
No habrán religiones, si entiendes que el dios es el mismo
No habría violencia, sí existiría paciencia
Habría unión si entiendes que el amor no es una ciencia
Fin del tiempo para el que no ve

Song: Travelling withouth moving

Get down, right on
Get down

I know all we're doing is
travelling without moving
hey hey
I know all we're doing is
travelling without moving
Can't stop, no
I know all we're doing is
travelling without moving
Yeah yeah
I know all we're doing
is travelling

Speed freak
Faster than a speedin' bullet,
Slow down, if I don't
If I don't might just lose it
Locked up
You've got me honey
Locked up under heavy brakin'
Yeah yeah
You know I've got to hang on
Drive too fast I might be last
oh yeah

I know all we're doing is
travelling without moving
Oh yeah
I know all we're doing is
travelling without moving
Wo yeah
I know all we're doing is
travelling without moving
Oh yeah
I know all we're doing is
travelling without moving
Wo yeah

I know all we're doing is
travelling without moving
Oh yeah
I know all we're doing is
travelling without moving
(repeat)

Song: Heathens - Aurora

She bargains with the world
So everything she wants will come to her
With no greed inside her mind
She knows what she deserves

We fell from sky with grace
And landed in her soft and warm embrace
She gave her love, her gift of life
So we could live with her

That is why we live like heathens
Stealing from the trees of Eden
Living in the arms of freedom
And everything we touch is evil
That is why we live like heathens

The stone, the dirt, the dust
The unforgiving promise made to us
Unworthy of your light, your god, your touch
We're guided by the lust

We cry the fallen names
We cry for those who burn beneath the flame
We stand besides the good and brave
The broken and enslaved

That is why we live like heathens
Stealing from the trees of Eden
Living in the arms of freedom
And everything we touch is evil
That is why we live like heathens

Everything you touch will be hers
A mother with no heart will give love

Her love is yours, but only if you give your heart to her

That is why we live like heathens
Stealing from the trees of Eden
Living in the arms of freedom
And everything we touch is evil

That is why we live like heathens
That is why we live like heathens
That is why we live like heathens

Song: What was I made for?  - Billie

I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
Just something you paid for
What was I made for?
'Cause I, I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might
When did it end? All the enjoyment
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
It's not what he's made for
What was I made for?
'Cause I, 'cause I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday I might
Someday I might
Think I forgot how to be happy
Something I'm not, but something I can be
Something I wait for
Something I'm made for
Something I'm made for
