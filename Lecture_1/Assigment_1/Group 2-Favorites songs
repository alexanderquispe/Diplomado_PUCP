Our favorites songs

1. Fernando Alonso Sanchez Prieto - Lana del Rey/The greatest

I miss Long Beach and I miss you, babe
I miss dancing with you the most of all
I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go
Dennis' last stop before Kokomo

Those nights were on fire
We couldn't get higher
We didn't know that we had it all
But nobody warns you before the fall

And I'm wasted
Don't leave, I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess I'm signing off after all

I miss New York and I miss the music
Me and my friends, we miss rock 'n' roll
I want shit to feel just like it used to
And baby, I was doing nothing the most of all

The culture is lit
And if this is it
I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all

I'm wasted
Don't leave, I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all

The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all
If this is it, I'm signing off
Miss doing nothing the most of all
Hawaii just missed a fireball
L.A. is in flames, it's getting hot
Kanye West is blond and gone
"Life on Mars" ain't just a song
Oh, the live stream's almost on

2. Valeria Pinchi - Rose/Gone - cpinchi@pucp.edu.pe
I thought that you'd remember, but it seems that you forgot
It's hard for me to blame you when you were already lost
Oh, yeah, I'm tired of always waiting, oh, yeah, yeah
I see you changed your number, that's why you don't get my calls
I gave you all of me, now you don't wanna be involved
Oh, yeah, yeah, I really gotta face it, oh, yeah, yeah
I just wanna be the one
But to you, we're already done
Tell me, why'd you have to hit-and-run me?
Now I'm all alone crying ugly
You broke my heart just for fun
Took my love and just left me numb
Now it's eight in the morning
Hate in the morning (all because of you)
Another story that's sad and true
I can feel the pain, can you?
You had to be the one to let me down
To color me blue
Hate to see you with someone new
I'll put a curse on her and you
Ain't no looking back, now you're dead and gone
My love is gone too


3. Jose Daniel Calderon Neyra - Gang of Youths/Achilles Come Down - calderon.daniel@pucp.edu.pe

Achilles, Achilles, Achilles, come down
Won't you get up off, get up off the roof?
You're scaring us and all of us, some of us love you
Achilles, it's not much but there's proof
You crazy-assed cosmonaut, remember your virtue
Redemption lies plainly in truth
Just humor us, Achilles, Achilles, come down
Won't you get up off, get up off the roof?
Je vois que beaucoup de gens meurent
Parce qu'ils estiment que la vie ne vaut pas la peine d'être vécue
J'en vois d'autres, qui se font paradoxalement tués pour des idées
Pour des illusions, qui leurs donnent une raison de vivre
Ce, qu'on appelle une raison de vivre est en même temps une excellente raison de mourir
Achilles, Achilles, Achilles, come down
Won't you get up off, get up off the roof?
The self is not so weightless, nor whole and unbroken
Remember the pact of our youth
Where you go, I'm going, so jump and I'm jumping
Since there is no me without you
Soldier on, Achilles, Achilles, come down
Won't you get up off, get up off the roof?
Loathe the way they light candles in Rome
But love the sweet air of the votives
Hurt and grieve but don't suffer alone
Engage with the pain as a motive
Today, of all days, see
How the most dangerous thing is to love
How you will heal and you'll rise above
D'un gérant d'immeuble qui s'était tué on disait un jour
Qu'il avait perdu sa fille depuis cinq ans
Qu'il avait beaucoup changé depuis et que cette histoire l'avait
Achilles, Achilles, Achilles, jump now
You are absent of cause or excuse
So self-indulgent and self-referential
No audience could ever want you
You crave the applause yet hate the attention
Then miss it, your act is a ruse
It is empty, Achilles, so end it all now
It's a pointless resistance for you
Ce qui déclenche la crise est presque toujours incontrôlable
Les journaux parlent souvent de chagrins intimes ou de maladie incurable
Ces explications sont valables
Mais il faudrait savoir si le jour même un ami
Du désespéré ne lui a pas parlé sur un ton indifférent
Celui-là est le
Achilles, Achilles, just put down the bottle
Don't listen to what you've consumed
It's chaos, confusion and wholly unworthy
Of feeding and it's wholly untrue
You may feel no purpose nor a point for existing
It's all just conjecture and gloom
And there may not be meaning, so find one and seize it
Do not waste yourself on this roof
Hear those bells ring deep in the soul
Chiming away for a moment
Feel your breath course frankly below
And see life as a worthy opponent
Today, of all days, see
How the most dangerous thing is to love
How you will heal and you'll rise above
Crowned by an overture bold and beyond
Ah, it's more courageous to overcome
Les souvenirs d'une patrie perdue, l'espoir d'une terre promise
Ce divorce entre l'homme de sa vie
You want the acclaim, the mother of mothers (it's not worth it, Achilles)
More poignant than fame or the taste of another (don't listen, Achilles)
But be real and just jump, you dense motherfucker (you're worth more, Achilles)
You will not be more than a rat in the gutter (so much more than a rat)
You want my opinion, my opinion you've got (no one asked your opinion)
You asked for my counsel, I gave you my thoughts (no one asked for your thoughts)
Be done with this now and jump off the roof (be done with this now and get off the roof)
Can you hear me, Achilles? I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
Achilles, come down
Achilles, come down
Celle du oui et celle du non
Ce serait trop beau
Mais il faut faire la part de ceux qui, sans conclure, interrogent toujours
Ici, j'ironise à peine, il s'agit de la majorité
Je vois également que ceux qui répondent non agissent comme s'ils pensaient oui
De fait
Throw yourself into the unknown
With pace and a fury defiant
Clothe yourself in beauty untold
And see life as a means to a triumph
Today, of all days, see
How the most dangerous thing is to love
How you will heal and you'll rise above
Crowned by an overture bold and beyond
Ah, it's more courageous to overcome

4. María Inés Herrera – Vienna/Billy Joel - miherrera@pucp.edu.pe

Slow down you crazy child
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you're so smart tell me
Why are you still so afraid? (mmmmm)
Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You better cool it off before you burn it out
You got so much to do and only
So many hours in a day (Ay)
But you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want
Or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through (Oooh)
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?
Slow down you're doing fine
You can't be everything you want to be before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight (tonight)
Too bad, but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong
You know you can't always see when you're right (you're right)
You got your passion, you got your pride
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true (Oooh)
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?
Slow down you crazy child
Take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while
It's alright, you can afford to lose a day or two (oooh)
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?
And you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through (oooh)
Why don't you realize, Vienna waits for you?
When will you realize, Vienna waits for you?
