My favorite song

FERNANDO MENDOZA - "Space Oddity" - David Bowie

    Ground Control to Major Tom
    Ground Control to Major Tom
    Take your protein pills and put your helmet on

    Ground Control to Major Tom
    Commencing countdown, engines on
    Check ignition and may God's love be with you

    Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six, Five, Four, Three, Two, One, Lift off

    This is Ground Control to Major Tom
    You've really made the grade
    And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
    Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare

    This is Major Tom to Ground Control
    I'm stepping through the door
    And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
    And the stars look very different today

    For here
    Am I sitting in a tin can
    Far above the world
    Planet Earth is blue
    And there's nothing I can do

    Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
    I'm feeling very still
    And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
    Tell my wife I love her very much she knows

    Ground Control to Major Tom
    Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
    Can you hear me, Major Tom?
    Can you hear me, Major Tom?
    Can you hear me, Major Tom?
    Can you...

    Here am I floating round my tin can
    Far above the Moon
    Planet Earth is blue
    And there's nothing I can do
