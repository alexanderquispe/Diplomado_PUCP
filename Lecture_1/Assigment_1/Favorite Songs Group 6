1. Milagros Meza - Dance with somebody

Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up 'till now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take the chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Somebody who, somebody who
Somebody who loves me yeah
Somebody who, somebody who
To hold me in his arms oh
I need a man who'll take the chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Ooh ooh (dance)
Come on baby (dance)
Ooh, yeah (dance)
Now get with this
Whoah!
Don'tcha wanna dance with me baby?
Don'tcha wanna dance with me boy?
Hey don'tcha wanna dance with me baby?
With somebody who loves me?

2. Kerly Tito

In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promised myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower

And climbing to the top
Will throw myself off
In an effort to make it clear to whoever
What it's like when you're shattered

Left standing in the lurch, at a church
Where people saying
My God, that's tough, she stood him up
No point in us remaining

We may as well go home?
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do?
The role I was about to play

But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much, as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces

Leaving me to doubt
All about God and his mercy
For if He really does exist
Why did he desert me?

In my hour of need?
I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts broken in the world
That can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? What do we do?

Alone again, naturally

Now looking back over the years
And what ever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears

And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken

Leaving her to start with a heart
So badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken

And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally

3. Gino Salvattore Reyna Nieva - Lose Yourself

Look
If you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip? Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad, but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him and

(You better lose) yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

(You better lose) yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

You better

His soul's escapin' through this hole that is gapin'
This world is mine for the takin', make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is borin', but superstardom's
Close to postmortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on
Da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

(You better lose) yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

(You better lose) yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

You better

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-five
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

(You better lose) yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

(You better lose) yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

You better

4. Serghi Arista (serghi.arista4@gmail.com) - Save your tears

I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care

I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day (So)

I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time

I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said, I make you cry when I run away

Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better

Save your tears for another day (Oh yeah)
Save your tears for another day (Yeah)

I don't know why I run away
I'll make you cry when I run away

Save your tears for another day
Ooh, girl, I said (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)

Save your tears for another day (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)
