Se Pareció Tanto a Ti

¿Quién no dice una mentira
Por conservar un amor?
¿Quién no inventa una historieta
Por evitar un dolor?

¿Quién no se moja los labios
Con otros que sepan a miel?
¿Quién no cae ante el deseo
Y terminar siendo infiel?

Recordar todo en silencio
Como extraños nos sentimos
Paso a paso detallamos
Con cinismo comparamos

Y esa duda que nos mata
Y que asalta, que atenaza
Tus sentidos los vulnera
Nos tortura nos delata

Y no saber si es mejor
Mientras duerme le relatas

Amor se pareció tanto a ti
Que no pude guardar
En mi cuerpo el deseo
Que la tuve que amar
Sentí la necesidad
De tenerme que entregar
Sentí miedo sentí el peso de poderme equivocar

Fue como llegar a casa primero de mi viaje
Como empezar de nuevo después de disgustar
Como adelantar las caricias cuando nos pensábamos casar
O sentir la melodía antes de hacer esta canción

Como si la noche durara un poco más en vez de amanecer
Como si la lluvia cayera sin presagio cuando hay Sol
Como si el sueño se realizara mucho antes de vivir
Como si el niño llorara mucho antes de nacer

Amor se pareció tanto a ti
Que el nombre llevaban por igual
Y la misma prisa cuando solían caminar
Hasta el guiño y la sonrisa me parecieron tan igual
Sentí miedo sentí el peso
De quererme enamorar otra vez

(Y no podría decirle otra cosa si la veo
Que la extraño, que la pienso)
(Y no podría decirle otra cosa si la veo)
Y sigues viviendo en mí
Quisiera hacerte feliz y no puedo

(Y no podría decirle otra cosa si la veo)
Que no soy yo quien decide en este caso
Por eso el motivo y la causa de mi fracaso

(Y no podría decirle otra cosa si la veo
Que la extraño, que lo siento)

Y no podría decirle otra cosa si la veo
Que lo siento, ohhh

Kind of magic

It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
A kind of magic (No way)
One dream, one soul
One prize, one goal
One golden glance of what should be
It's a kind of magic
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day
It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Is this a kind of magic?
It's a kind of magic
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
It's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be, will soon be done
This is (this is) a kind (a kind) of magic (yeah)
There can be only one (one, one, one)
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done (done)
Magic (it's a kind of magic)
It's a kind of magic
Magic magic magic (magic)
It's a kind of magic

Someone Like You

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
And I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over
Nevermind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah
You'd know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
And I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over yet
Nevermind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they are memories made
Who would have known
How bittersweet this would taste?
Nevermind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Nevermind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

Bohemian Rhapsody

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro, magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
بِسْمِ ٱللَّٰهِ
No, we will not let you go (let him go)
بِسْمِ ٱللَّٰهِ
We will not let you go (let him go)
بِسْمِ ٱللَّٰهِ
We will not let you go (let me go)
Will not let you go (let me go)
Never, never, never, never let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia
Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
Ooh
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

Rolling in the deep

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one of you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could've had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could've had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could've had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat

Eres

Eres
Lo que más quiero en este mundo, eso eres
Mi pensamiento más profundo también eres
Tan sólo dime lo que hago, aquí me tienes

Eres
Cuando despierto, lo primero, eso eres
Lo que a mi vida le hace falta si no vienes
Lo único, preciosa, que en mi mente habita hoy

¿Qué más puedo decirte?
Tal vez puedo mentirte sin razón
Pero lo que hoy siento
Es que sin ti estoy muerto, pues eres
Lo que más quiero en este mundo, eso eres

Eres
El tiempo que comparto, eso eres
Lo que la gente promete cuando se quiere
Mi salvación, mi esperanza y mi fe

Soy
El que quererte quiere como nadie, soy
El que te llevaría el sustento día a día, día a día
El que por ti daría la vida, ese soy

Aquí estoy a tu lado
Y espero aquí sentado hasta el final
No te has imaginado
Lo que por ti he esperado, pues eres
Lo que yo amo en este mundo, eso eres
Cada minuto en lo que pienso, eso eres
Lo que más cuido en este mundo eso eres
